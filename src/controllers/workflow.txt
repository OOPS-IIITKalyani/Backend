ok ill need another sprint 
till now done  
- getting the json symptoms
- Trimming unnecesary feilds
- loading the one of symptoms and making a hashmap
- reading the csv header and then convering into a set
- using the set to go trough array of symptom and make its specific vector (only the reduced columns are considered)

todos

- make a function that reads all the diseases one by one and then return the most probable diseases with symptoms match
- integrate off of symptoms
- better the code

and just figure out a better workflow + better code
